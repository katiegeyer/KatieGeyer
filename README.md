### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Katie Geyer - Full Stack Developer
Hello there! :wave: I'm Katie, a full-stack web developer with a solid grounding in Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML5, CSS, and more. My journey in software development began at App Academy, where I learned to build dynamic, user-friendly web applications using frameworks and tools like React.js, Redux, Flask, Express, and NodeJS.

Before diving into the world of tech, I dedicated my career to hydrology and environmental sustainability. This background fuels my commitment to build solutions that are not only effective but also sustainable and environmentally friendly.

My knack for problem-solving and innovation is matched by a passion for creating user-centric designs. Leveraging my expertise in UI/UX design, I love to make applications that are as pleasing to the eye as they are to use. :art: :computer:

I also bring to the table:

Strong skills in Object-Oriented Programming, pair programming, and test-driven development.
Experience in Agile and SCRUM methodologies.
Proven expertise in modern web development technologies.
Proven expertise in cloud technologies like AWS and container technologies like Docker.
Passion for environmental sustainability and water conservation.
When I'm not behind the screen, you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors, fostering dogs, or volunteering for city sustainability initiatives. :dog: :deciduous_tree:
